# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Utilize Python and Scikit-learn library to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict credit risk.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize Python for building multiple machine learning models to predict credit risk.  A credit dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company is provided as the input for four algorithms and two classifiers to evaluate the performance of the various models.  The results are analyzed to provide a recommendation on which, if any, model should be used to predict risk. 


## Results

The performance of the six machine learning models are explained including screenshots of each model's output below:

## Summary



The purpose of this project is to utilize PySpark, AWS RDS, and PGAdmin to analyze Amazon reviews on a select group of products and determine if there are any biases by
 members of the paid Amazon Vine program.  This program is a service wherein manufacturers and publishers pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Vine members
 in return for a published review.

One of fifty datasets containing specific product reviews is selected.  PySpark is used to run the dataset through the ETL (extract, transform, load) process connecting
 to an AWS RDS instance and load data into PGAdmin.  PySpark methods and functions are developed to analyze the dataset and determine bias levels by paid Vine members.
